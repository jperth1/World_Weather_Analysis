## Overview of World Weather Analysis

This repository performs three actions in efforts to present a potential travel itenerary based on the preference of the traveler.  The three actions are as follows:
1. Retrieve weather data for 2,000 randomly generated latitudes and longitudes, retrieve the nearest city to these coordinates, and perform an API call with the OpenWeatherMap to display relavant weather data for those cities in a DataFrame.
2. Create a customer travel destinations map using input statements to retrieve customer weather preferences, then use those preferences to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels, which is shown in a marker layer map with pop-up markers using Google.
